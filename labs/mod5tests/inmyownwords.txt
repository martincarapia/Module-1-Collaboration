At the end of the notebook, 
describe the test results in your own words.  
What do the test results mean?

The test results returned saying "Fraction(9,10) != 1". This is
true because they are not equal. This result tells me, a developer, that 
the passed result is not equal to the integer 1. This helps me troubleshoot.
I also am told that 2 ran but 1 failed meaning that 1 passed.
